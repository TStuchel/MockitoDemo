/**
 * DEVELOPER NOTE: A single instance of this class will be instantiated and populated based on the contents of
 * src/main/java/resources/application.yml which is further decided based on the currently active profile. There are
 * other ways to load properties into a Spring application, such as injecting properties using @Value.
 * <p>
 * See: https://www.baeldung.com/properties-with-spring
 * <p>
 * The @Getter and @Setter annotations are Lombok library annotations that build getter and setter methods for each of
 * of the properties. These are needed for the configuration to be loaded. The full details of configuration properties
 * can be found here:
