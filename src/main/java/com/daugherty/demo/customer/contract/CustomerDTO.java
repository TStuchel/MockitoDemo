    // -------------------------------------------------- PROPERTIES ---------------------------------------------------

    // DEVELOPER NOTE: Properties of a DTO contract should always be an object type, not a primitive (except String,
    // it's  a special case). This allows fields to be absent from JSON during de-serialization and allow for fields
    // with a null value. Primitive types such as integers will will be set to a default value such as zero, which isn't
    // the same as "absent".
    @JsonProperty("id")
    private Integer id;

    // DEVELOPER NOTE: While not required, using @JsonProperty lets you set the property name as seen in the serialized
    // JSON of this class to something different than the Java property. This is useful when refactoring the name of
    // the Java property without having to break the contract.
    @JsonProperty("fullName")
    private String fullName;

    // DEVELOPER NOTE: @JsonFormat used here defines the string representation of this ZonedDateTime that will be seen
    // in the JSON. This isn't the whole story, though. You must also register the jsr310 module with Spring and/or
    // any ObjectMapper that might serialize/deserialize this class. This lets ObjectMapper know how to serialize and
    // deserialize ZonedDateTime.
    @JsonProperty("lastReadTimestamp")
    @JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.STRING, pattern = "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ")
    private ZonedDateTime lastReadTimestamp;

    // DEVELOPER NOTE: If there is no "orderNumbers" property in the JSON, then this List will be 'null'. See below.
    @JsonProperty("orderNumbers")

    /**
     * Return list of order numbers associated with this customer.
     * <p>
     * DEVELOPER NOTE: The @Data annotation is a Lombok library annotation that would automatically create this method
     * behind the scenes. However, since it is implemented here, Lombok will not create a getOrderNumbers() method and
     * will leave this one as the implementation to use. This method ensures that it's impossible for getOrderNumbers()
     * to return a null, thus the developer doesn't have to worry about null checks when using this List property in
     * case the JSON didn't have the orderNumbers property.
