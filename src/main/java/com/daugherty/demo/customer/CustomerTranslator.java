/**
 * Translate to and from CustomerDTO web service contracts and Customer business entities.
 * <p>
 * DEVELOPER NOTE: This layer of abstraction may seem like overkill. However, if you tie your business logic to web
 * service contract classes, then it becomes increasingly difficult to version your web service endpoints. Having a
 * separate entity class, even if it's nearly identical to the contract class, allows for an evolving layer of business
 * logic while at the same time remaining backward compatible with any API versioning that is necessary. Also, having
 * proper business entity classes allows for implementing the "tell, don't ask" design principle.
