/**
 * This JPA (Java Persistence Architecture) repository interface provides methods to return Customer data from the
 * database.
 * <p>
 * DEVELOPER NOTE: This is the third and "deepest" layer of the application architecture. This layer is sometimes
 * called the "data access layer" (and repositories called "Data Access Objects" or DAO objects). This layer shouldn't
 * have ANY business logic in it at all. The only responsibility of a repository class is to either interface with a
 * database to retrieve and manipulate data, or to interact with an external web service. The service layer of this
 * application doesn't know or care where the repository got its data, or how it got it. It should also be "dumb" and
 * just do its job of putting and pulling data from the external source, not making business or quality decisions about
 * the data.
 * <p>
 * This class is annotated as a @Repository, which is just an alias for the annotation @Component. In this case, the
 * repository is a JPA repository. Spring "magic" will automatically create an implementation of this repository that
 * will be capable of reading and writing Customer entities from the database. Technically, the JPA framework itself is
 * serving as the actual repository layer.
