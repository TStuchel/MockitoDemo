/**
 * Business entity representing a Customer. This business entity is able to be persisted to a database using JPA.
 * <p>
 * DEVELOPER NOTE: This class has the @Entity annotation to tell JPA that this is a class that it must care about since
 * instances of this class represent a rows in a table (and thus business entities). This is called an ORM
 * (Object-Relational-Mapper). JPA is an API that wraps an underlying ORM... in this case, Hibernate. The @Table
 * annotation is so that JPA knows the actual name of the database table that holds these entities. The @Column
 * annotation tells JPA the actual name of the database column in that table.
 * <p>
 * The @Data annotation has nothing to do with databases or JPA. This annotation is a Lombok library annotation that
 * automatically generates property getter and setter methods so that you don't have to. It even makes an equals()
 * method that can compare the properties between two objects to determine if they are "logically" equal.
