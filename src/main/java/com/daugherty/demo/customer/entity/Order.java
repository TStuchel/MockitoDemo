     * DEVELOPER NOTE: JPA relationships are bi-directional. A Customer knows its Orders, but an Order also knows to
     * which Customer it belongs. So, there can be many Orders that belong to One customer (per the @ManyToOne
     * annotation). Notice that that the @JoinColumn is designating a database foreign key back to the Customer table.
     * <p>
     * Take a moment to think about this... a "parent" Java class has to know it's "children" (via a collection
     * property), but a "child" class doesn't have to know its "parent". But in a relational database, a "parent" table
     * doesn't know its "children", but the rows of a "child" table have to know what "parent" the row belongs to.
     * <p>
     * Basically, Java and relational databases associate entities in reverse. JPA navigates this by having
     * bi-directional references in Java.
