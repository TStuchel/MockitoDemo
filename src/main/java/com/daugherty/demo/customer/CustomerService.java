/**
 * This class provides business functionality for managing Customers.
 * <p>
 * DEVELOPER NOTE: This is the second, and middle, layer of a web application. It is frequently called the "service
 * layer" or "business logic layer". This layer is the core of the application, containing the classes that actually
 * provide business value and define the real functionality of the application. Previously, the API/Controller layer
 * cared only about receiving and returning JSON requests. This class is the real meat of the system... and
 * theoretically shouldn't know anything about the fact that it "lives" in a web application. There's nothing related
 * to JSON, REST, HTTP, or web services here.
 * <p>
 * This class is annotated as a @Service, which is just an alias for the annotation @Component. Some things care about
 * the @Service annotation, but for the most part it's just a way to be a bit more descriptive about the kind of
 * component that this class is.
 * <p>
 * Also, this layer shouldn't care from *where* it gets the data that it operates on. Service classes shouldn't  know
 * anything about databases, external web services, file systems, or any other technicalities of shuttling data
 * around the system. That's the job of the final layer.

     * to the Repository, but this is a bad idea. It's best to respect the 3-layered nature of the application
